# AB-simulation
This repository contains the material related to a simulation of the Aharonov-Bohm effect prepared to complete an essay about this topic. It is part of the "Advanced Quantum Mechanics" course in the Master's in Quantum Science and Technology. The main script has been taken from Ref. [1], and addapted to complete our goals. The main challenge has been to modify the simulation is such a way to sample intermediate states, in order to visualize the whole process.
